        ">It was when I rang in my 25th year that I decided to move out of the parents house, get a little place, and start being an "adult". How could this hapen without a pet, you ask?</p>

        ">I adopted my two kittens from <a href = "https://odas.org/">Open Door Animal Sanctuary</a> in September of 2017. It was such an easy process. They have a kitten room where the kittens are free roaming. It made it super easy to see each kittens personality and how they interacted with each other! It was also a good way to see not only which one you liked, but which one actually liked you!</p>
        <p class="paragraph
        ">Initially, I wanted to adopt one kitten. That did not end up being the case (thank goodness)! They recommended adopting two kittens as oposed to one, because that way they have a buddy to tire them out. If you adopt just one kitten, you run the risk of said kitten becoming nocturnal. NOT ideal for someone who loves sleep as much as I do! Enter: Lola and Oliver.</p>
